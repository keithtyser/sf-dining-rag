# Implementation Plan Document: RAG-based Conversational AI Chatbot for Restaurant Data

This document provides a step-by-step guide to implement a conversational AI chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The chatbot will answer queries about restaurants, menus, and ingredients by integrating structured CSV data with unstructured external data and by using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo for generating responses. Each step includes checkboxes for you to mark off as you complete it.
