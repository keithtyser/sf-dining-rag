## Next Steps
1. API Development
   - [ ] Set up FastAPI server
   - [ ] Create API models:
     - [ ] Request models for queries and chat
     - [ ] Response models with proper typing
     - [ ] Error response models
   - [ ] Create endpoints for:
     - [ ] Query processing (/api/query)
     - [ ] Chat completion (/api/chat)
     - [ ] Restaurant information retrieval (/api/restaurants)
   - [ ] Add middleware for:
     - [ ] Error handling
     - [ ] Request validation
     - [ ] Rate limiting
   - [ ] Add API documentation using FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI

2. Testing and Optimization
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite:
     - [ ] Unit tests for core functions
     - [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
     - [ ] End-to-end conversation tests
   - [ ] Add performance monitoring:
     - [ ] Response time tracking
     - [ ] Error rate monitoring
     - [ ] Usage statistics
   - [ ] Optimize vector search:
     - [ ] Fine-tune similarity threshold
     - [ ] Adjust result count based on query type
     - [ ] Implement query preprocessing
   - [ ] Add caching:
     - [ ] Vector search results
     - [ ] Common API responses
     - [ ] Restaurant data
   - [ ] Load test API endpoints:
     - [ ] Concurrent user simulation
     - [ ] Response time under load
     - [ ] Resource usage monitoring

3. Documentation and Deployment
   - [ ] Create comprehensive documentation:
     - [ ] API usage guide
     - [ ] System architecture
     - [ ] Deployment instructions
   - [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
   - [ ] Prepare deployment configuration
   - [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
